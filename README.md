# BDD100K-Segmentation
UNET trained on the BDD100K dataset to detect the current road lane in an image.

Based on this tutorial : [Creating a Very Simple U-Net Model with PyTorch for Semantic Segmentation of Satellite Images](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/creating-a-very-simple-u-net-model-with-pytorch-for-semantic-segmentation-of-satellite-images-223aa216e705)
Because I didn't get good results after training the model for a while, I chose to opt for a more efficient segmentation model.
